# ServerProt

ServerProt is a discord multi-purpose bot. You can use this to activley moderate your server.

There is a /config/ folder, which was removed from the initial github repository, as it includes sensitive data. There will not be an example.config.json file, as you can figure it out. This is not ment to be self-hosted / edited, but you may.
